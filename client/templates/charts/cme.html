	<h1>Recent Coronal Mass Ejections (CME's)</h1>

	<p>
		CME's are what cause an aurora. When a CME is detected on the sun, we typically have between 1-5 days till
		it hits Earth (<em>if</em> it hits Earth at all).
	</p>
	<p>
		The prominent space weather authorities seldom agree on an arrival time, much less get it accurately correct.
		Nethertheless; CME's are the precursor to an Aurora, so if you are on the hunt - it's good tactic to keep an
		ear/eye out for CME's, and then attempt to hone in on the event as it unfolds.

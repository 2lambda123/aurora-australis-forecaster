				about 1,500,000km from Earth - which gives us up to <strong>1 hour advance warning</strong> to get to a good spot once a storm hits.

					<h3>Earth, L1 and the Sun</h3>
					<p>
						The DSCOVR is Americaâ€™s first operational deep space satellite, which orbits one million miles from Earth.
						Positioned between the sun and Earth at Lagrange point 1, it is able to maintain a constant view of the sun and sun-lit side
						of Earth - which helps to increase the accuracy of predicting the likelihood of an Aurora.
					</p>
					<p>
						This improved accuracy is very important - because predicting an Aurora on Earth with <em>any</em>
						confidence is extremely difficult, due the high number of impacting variables - most of which
						are hard to quantify, or predict with accuracy (many experienced 'Aurora Chasers' might call it an art).
					</p>
					<p>
						That is why this tool is geared towards making conservative forecasts with higher confidence,
						instead of longer range predictions based on historically unreliable data.
					</p>

					<h3>1 hour isn't much notice? <i class="fa fa-frown-o"></i> </h3>
					<p>
						Yep. Life is hard as an Aurora Chaser, and so are long-range weather forecasts. <br/>
						This tool was mostly just built so we wouldn't have to get up at intervals through
						the night to check the data - we can just set an alarm and have the system send us an alert
						when the storm hits L1.
					</p>
					<p>
						For long-range predictions, the Aurora Australis Forecaster is can be used
						in a three-step approach:
						<ol>
							<li>Check the CME data for advanced warnings of potential storms heading our way
								(typically 1-5 days warning when a CME occurs, but we get a rough idea of what
								<em>day</em> it <em>might hit.</em>
							</li>
							<li>
								Watch the forecasts to get a better idea if CME's are actually likely to hit Earth,
								and to get a rough idea of when they might arrive.
							</li>
							<li>
								Monitor the data coming from L1 to get ~1hr notice when incoming storm has been confirmed
								(then it's fingers crossed it's nighttime, there's no cloud cover, the moon is right, and you have your lucky undies on).
							</li>
						</ol>
						* public alert system will be made available so you don't get square eyes checking the data all day/night.

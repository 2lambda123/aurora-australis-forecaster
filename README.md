# aurora-australis-forecaster

A cross-platform application for aggregating and visualising Aurora Australis forecast data.

## Core features/requirements
<ul>
	<li>Provide simple forecast/status updates for geophysically-illiterate users; while also enabling advanced users to 'drill-down' to perform more detailed analysis.</li>
	<li>Define the major impacting factors, and develop an aggregated metric scale to roughly quantify potential aurora quality <strong>in a given location</strong>.</li>
	<li>Leverage best available data.</li>
	<li>Application to be delivered via the web, iOS and Android. For free.</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>

## Wishlist features
<ul>
	<li>Allow power users to adjust metric weightings</li>
	<li>Alert system, e.g. let me know if there's a forecast <code> >= x </code> score for location <code>y</code></li>
	<li>FAQ</li>
	<li>Gallery</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>


## Potential metrics (roughly high to low weighting)
<ul>
	<li>Kp Index (probably http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/)</li>
	<li>Solar Winds (Bz, Speed, Density: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/)</li>
	<li>Localised cloud cover (?)</li>
	<li>Moonlight, or light pollution (?)</li>
</ul>


## Interested/want to help?
I'd love to hear from you! Really, I'm new to whole aurora scene and am simply building this as a way to learn more. 
So I'd greatly appreciate: 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Feature requests</strong> - or suggestions of things you think would be useful</li>
	<li><strong>Data</strong> - specifically any live or regularly updated data feeds that would be relevant (we love data)</li>
	<li><strong>Help</strong> - if you're a developer and are keen to get involved drop me a line or shoot me a pull request. 
	The best bit of code is the bit you don't have to write yourself ;)</li>
	<li>...</li>
</ul>
